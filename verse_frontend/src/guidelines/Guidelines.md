**Add your own guidelines here**
* Only use absolute positioning when necessary. Opt for responsive and well structured layouts that use flexbox and grid by default
* Refactor code as you go to keep code clean
* Keep file sizes small and put helper functions and components in their own files.
* Put API handlers into a 'services' folder
* Put utility functions and classes into a 'utils' folder
* Use React Context in the 'contexts' folder to manage global state
